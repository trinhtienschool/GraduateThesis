I have to say, she LOVES IT! I am responsible for the phone purchases for my family. We have T-Mobile and they don't subsidize phones anymore so I needed to replace my wife's older phone with a quality no contract phone and after researching for 3 months, I decided to try BLU. The phone came quickly and it even had the screen protector already installed. I put in the micro sim card and we were off and running! I will admit after using the phone for a hour straight to get all apps loaded and other settings fine tuned, the phone back got very warm! I was a little surprised however if cooled down once we were done and let the phone sit. The screen is awesome! Everything installed with no issues. I had my wife let me know if she had any issues and after a month and a half, the only complaint she has had is the phone back gets warm when she uses it to play her games. She will sit for few hours after dinner and play her games on her phone. When she does, the phone gets very warm. From my research it looks like this is common with a ton of other phones when you use it to play apps hours on end. I am not familiar with this as i don't play games on my phone and never had any heat issues with my Nexus 5. Back to the BLU, the only other complaint my wife had is the camera. The phone takes very nice pictures however you must stay very still and the lag between snapping pictures is torturous. You have to stand still and have your subject stay still, even after you press the photo button. I think this is my be a software issue and maybe BLU will come out with an update. Other than the heat issue and the camera, there are no other issues. The phone came with a case, can't beat that! The battery lasts all day, needs to be recharged each night. Apps open quick and videos play with no lag. I still gave the phone 5 stars because I am not sold the heat issue is only BLU and the camera takes really nice photos even with the lag and the bottom line is my wife got a lot of phone for the price. The LTE works fine with T-Mobile. No issues there! I will buy additional phones from BLU as more of my family members are in need of an upgraded phone. I just ordered a BLU Studio LTE for my youngest son. I will review that one after living with it for a month.   \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      HTC One in White is good; in black it is better.
